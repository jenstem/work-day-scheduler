## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a work day scheduler that would display the current date.  The scheduler would allow the user to see what was coming up on their current schedule by showing each time block in a different color for past, present and future.

When the user types something in to their schedule and clicks the save button to the corresponding time block, the event is saved to local storage even if the user refreshes the page.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule\
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner\
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule\
WHEN I open the planner\
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar\
WHEN I scroll down\
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm\
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day\
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future\
WHEN I click into a time block\
THEN I can enter an event\
WHEN I click the save button for that time block\
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage\
WHEN I refresh the page\
THEN the saved events persist
